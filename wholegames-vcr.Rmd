# Use vcr

In this chapter we aim at adding HTTP testing infrastructure to exemplighratia using vcr.

## Setup

We need to install `{vcr}`.

First, we need to run `vcr::use_vcr()` which has a few effects

* Adding vcr as a dependency to `DESCRIPTION`, under Suggests just like testthat.
* Creating an example test file for us to look at. This is useful the first few times you use vcr, after a while you might even delete it without reading it.
* Adding a `.gitattributes` file with the line `tests/fixtures/**/* -diff` which will hide the changes in your cassettes from the git diff. It makes your git diff easier to deal with. [^secrets]
* Creating a helper file under tests/testthat,

```r
library("vcr")
invisible(vcr::vcr_configure(
  dir = "../fixtures"
))
vcr::check_cassette_names()
```

When testthat runs tests, files whose name starts with "helper" are always run first. This one makes sure to load vcr, indicated where mocked responses are saved, and checks that you are not using the same name twice for cassettes (mock files).

We tweak vcr helper a bit

* We do not want our API token to appear in the mock responses so we use the `filter_sensitive_data` argument of `vcr::vcr_configure()`.

* We need to ensure that we set up a fake API key when there is no API token around.
Why? Because if you remember well, the code of our function `gh_organizations()` checks for the presence of a token.
With mock responses around, we obviously don't really need a token but we still need to fool our own package in contexts where there is no token (e.g. in continuous integration checks for a fork of a GitHub repository).

```r
library("vcr")

vcr_dir <- "../fixtures"

if (!nzchar(Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT"))) {
  if (dir.exists(vcr_dir)) {
    Sys.setenv("GITHUB_PAT" = "foobar")
  } else {
    stop("No API key nor cassettes, tests cannot be run.",
         call. = FALSE)
  }
}

invisible(vcr::vcr_configure(
  dir = vcr_dir,
  filter_sensitive_data = list("<<github_api_token>>" = Sys.getenv('GITHUB_PAT'))
))
```

So this was just setup, now on to adapting our tests!

## Actual testing

The key function will be `vcr::use_cassette("cassette-informative-and-unique-name", {<our-code>})` which tells vcr to create a mock file to store all API responses for API calls occurring in the code block.


Let's tweak the test for `gh_api_status`, it now becomes

```r
vcr::use_cassette("gh_api_status", {
  test_that("gh_api_status() works", {
    testthat::expect_type(gh_api_status(), "character")
  })
})
```

If we run this test (in RStudio clicking on "Run test"), 

* the first time, vcr creates a cassette (mock file) under `tests/testthat/gh_api_status.yml` where it stores the API response.
It contains all the things, header included.

  recorded_with: vcr/0.5.4, webmockr/0.7.0
```

* all the times after that, vcr simply uses the mock files instead of actually calling the API.

Let's tweak our other test, of `gh_organizations()`

```r
vcr::use_cassette("gh_organizations", {
  test_that("gh_organizations works", {
    testthat::expect_type(gh_organizations(), "character")
  })
})
```

The first time we run it, vcr creates a cassette where we notice these lines

```yaml
http_interactions:
- request:
    method: get
    uri: https://api.github.com/organizations?since=1
    body:
      encoding: ''
      string: ''
    headers:
      Accept: application/json, text/xml, application/xml, */*
      Content-Type: ''
      Authorization: token <<github_api_token>>
```

Our API token has been replaced with the string we indicated in `vcr::vcr_configure()`.

## Summarize

* We set up vcr using `use_vcr()` and tweaking the helper file to fool our own package that needs an API token.
* We wrapped our `test_that()` blocks into `vcr::use_cassette()` and ran the tests a first time to generate mock files that hold the API interactions.

Now, how do we make sure this works?

* Turn off wifi, run the tests again. It works! Turn on wifi again.
* Open .Renviron (`usethis::edit_r_environ()`), edit "GITHUB_PAT" into "byeGITHUB_PAT", re-start R, run the tests again. It works! Fix your "GITHUB_PAT" token in .Renviron.

So we now have tests that no longer rely on an internet connection nor on having API credentials.

**How do we get there with other packages? Let's try httptest in the next chapter!**

## PS: Where to put use_cassette()

Where do we put the `vcr::use_cassette()` call?
Well as written in the manual page of that function, _There's a few ways to get correct line numbers for failed tests and one way to not get correct line numbers:_
What's correct?
* Wrapping the whole `testthat::test_that()` call;

```r
vcr::use_cassette("thing, {
  testthat::test_that("thing", {
    lala <- get_foo()
    expect_true(lala)
  })
})
```

* Wrapping a few lines inside `testthat::test_that()` **excluding the expectactions `expect_blabla()`**

````r
testthat::test_that("thing", {
  vcr::use_cassette("thing, {
    lala <- get_foo()
  })
    expect_true(lala)
})
````

What's incorrect?

````r
testthat::test_that("thing", {
  vcr::use_cassette("thing, {
    lala <- get_foo()
    expect_true(lala)
  })
})
````

We used the solution of wrapping whole `test_that` blocks because we already haf written tests; and because it will be one difference less with httptest in the next chapter.
