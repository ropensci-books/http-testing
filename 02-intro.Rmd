## What is webmockr? {#what-webmockr}

`webmockr` is an R package to help you "mock" HTTP requests. What does mock mean? Mock refers to the fact that we're faking the response. Here is how it works:

* You "stub" a request. That is, you set rules for what HTTP request you'd like to match on
* You also can set rules for what you'd like to respond with, if anything (if nothing, then we give you `NULL`)
* Then you make HTTP requests, and those that match your stub will return what you requested be returned
* While `webmockr` is in use, real HTTP interactions are not allowed
* There is no recording interactions to disk at all, just mocked responses given as the user specifies in the R session

`webmockr` works with both the `crul` package and the `httr` package.

Read more about `webmockr` in [Section 2](#mocking).

## What is vcr? {#what-vcr}

The short version is: `vcr` helps you stub HTTP requests so you don't have to repeat HTTP requests.

The main use case is for unit tests of R packages.

`vcr` works with both the `crul` package and the `httr` package.

`vcr` works by hooking into `webmockr`. However, when `webmockr` finds a match, we then look for a recorded interaction on disk. If one is not found, we record the request and response. If one is found, we use that recorded interaction to construct a real response as the R client expects.

## Why crul? {#why-crul}

`crul` is just one of the HTTP clients in R. It's the one that I maintain though, so
was easiest to get started with adding mocking integration.

There is now integration with `httr` for both `webmockr` and `vcr`.

The major feature that `httr` has that `crul` does not have is OAuth support, but that's 
not an important use case for me so is not a high priority for `crul`.

A major reason to use `crul` over `httr` is that it uses more of an object oriented 
interface. That is, you create objects that you can call methods on and retrieve 
variables/results from calls/etc. It's a different approach than `httr` which focuses
on passing things to functions.
