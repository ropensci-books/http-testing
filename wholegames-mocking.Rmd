# vcr and httptest

We have just followed very similar processes to add HTTP testing infrastructure involving mock files to exemplighratia

* Adding a package as a Suggests dependency;
* Creating a helper file that in particular loads this package before each test;
* Wrapping our tests into functions that allows to record API responses in mock files and to play them back from said mock files.

Now, there were a few differences. 
We won't end up advocating for one package in particular since both have their merits, but we do hope to help you differentiate the two packages.

## Setting up the infrastructure

To set up the HTTP testing infrastructure, in one case you need to run `vcr::use_vcr()` and in another case you need to run `httptest::use_httptest()`. Not too hard to remember.

## Calling mock files

As mentioned before, vcr and httptest both use mock files but they call them differently.

In vcr they are called both **fixtures** and **cassettes**.
In httptest they are called **mock files**.

## Naming mock files

With vcr the `use_cassette()` call needs to include a name that will be used to create the filename of the mock file.
The help of `?use_cassette` explains some criteria for naming them, such as the fact that cassette names need to be unique.
Now if you wrap your whole `test_that()` block in them you might just as well use a name similar to the test name, and you already make those meaningful, right?

With httptest the mock filepaths are translated from requests according to several rules that incorporate the request method, URL, query parameters, and body. 

## Handling secrets

With vcr, since everything from the HTTP interactions is recorded, you always need to add some sort of configuration to be sure to wipe your API tokens from the mock files.

With httptest, only responses are saved, and most often, only their bodies. 
Most often, responses don't contain secrets e.g. they don't contain your API token.
If the response contains secrets, refer to httptest's article about ["Redacting sensitive information"](https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/articles/redacting.html).

## Recording, playing back

When using mock files for testing, first you need to record responses in mock files; and then you want to use the mock files instead of real HTTP interactions (that's the whole point).

With vcr, the recording vs playing back modes happen automatically depending on the existence of the cassette. If you write `vcr::use_cassette("blabla", )` and there's no cassette called blabla, vcr will create it. Note that if you change the HTTP interactions in the code block, you'll have to re-record the cassette which is as simple as deleting it then running the test. _Note that you can also change the way vcr behaves by looking into `?vcr::vcr_configure`'s "Cassette Options"._

With httptest, there is a lot of flexibility around how to record mock files. It is because httptest doesn't assume that every API mock came from a real request to a real server; maybe you copy some of the mocks directly from the API docs.

## Conclusion

And now, to make things even more complex, or fun, we shall explore a third HTTP testing package that does not involve mock files of API responses.
