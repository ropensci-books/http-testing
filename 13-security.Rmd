## API keys and such {#api-keys}

The configuration parameter `filter_sensitive_data` accepts a named list.

Each element in the list should be of the following format:

`thing_to_replace_it_with = thing_to_replace`

We replace all instances of `thing_to_replace` with `thing_to_replace_it_with`.

Before recording (writing to a cassette) we do the replacement and then when
reading from the cassette we do the reverse replacement to get back
to the real data.

The before record replacement happens in an internal
function `write_interactions()`, while before playback replacement
happens in internal function `YAML$deserialize_path()`

```r
vcr_configure(
  filter_sensitive_data = list("<<<my_api_key>>>" = Sys.getenv('API_KEY'))
)
```

You want to make the string that replaces your sensitive string something that
won't be easily found elsewhere in the response body/headers/etc.

It's a good idea to not in place of `thing_to_replace` put your actual sensitive
key thing, because that defeats the purpose of trying to protect your private
data. This is why we highly recommend setting your API keys as environment
variables, then you can as seen above just put a call to `Sys.getenv()`,
which we'll use internally to get your key, find it anywhere in the HTTP
responses, and replace it with your placeholder string.

The reason you want to do this is because you may on purpose or on accident
push your cassettes to the public web, and when that happens you don't want
your private keys in those cassettes.

Note that the way this is implemented in `vcr` is not super elegant and is
not general with respect to the serializer. We only support YAML serializing
right now, but when we support other serializers we'll need to change the
implementation.

## API keys and tests run in varied contexts {#different-api-keys}

* For real requests a real API key is needed.
* For requests using cassettes a fake API key is needed to fool your package. That is 
why in our [demo of vcr](#vcr) we set a fake API key in a test setup file.

considered yet.
