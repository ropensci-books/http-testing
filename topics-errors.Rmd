# Faking HTTP errors {#errors-chapter}

With HTTP testing you can test the behavior of your package in case of an API error without having to actually trigger an API error.
This is important for testing your package's gracefulness (informative error message for the user) and robustness (if you e.g. use retrying in case of API errors).
