# Preamble

Are you working on an R package accessing resources on the web, be it a cat facts API, a scientific data source or your system for Customer relationship management?
As with all other packages, appropriate unit testing can make your code more robust.
The unit testing of a package interacting with web resources, however, brings special challenges: 
dependence of tests on a good internet connection, testing in the absence of authentication secrets, etc.
Having tests fail due to resources being down or slow, during development or on CRAN, means a time loss for everyone involved (slower development, messages from CRAN).
Although some packages accessing remote resources are well tested, there is a lack of resources around best practices.

This book is meant to be a free, central reference for developers of R packages accessing web resources, to help them have a faster and more robust development.
Our aim is to develop a useful guide to go with the great recent tools `{vcr}`, `{webmockr}`, `{httptest}`, `{httptest2}` and `{webfakes}`.

We expect you to know [package development basics](https://r-pkgs.org/), and [git](https://happygitwithr.com/).

_Note related to previous versions: this book was intended as a detailed guide to using a particular suite of packages for HTTP mocking and testing in R code and/or packages, namely those maintained by Scott Chamberlain (`{crul}`, `{webmockr}`, `{vcr}`), but its scope has been extended to generalize the explanation of concepts to similar packages._

You can also read the [PDF version](/http-testing/main.pdf) or [epub version](/http-testing/main.epub) of this book.
