## What is webmockr? {#what-webmockr}

`webmockr` is an R package to help you "mock" HTTP requests. What does mock mean? Mock refers to the fact that we're faking the response. Here is how it works:

* You "stub" a request. That is, you set rules for what HTTP request you'd like to match on
* You also can set rules for what you'd like to respond with, if anything (if nothing, then we give you `NULL`)
* Then you make HTTP requests, and those that match your stub will return what you requested be returned
* While `webmockr` is in use, real HTTP interactions are not allowed
* There is no recording interactions to disk at all, just mocked responses given as the user specifies in the R session

## What is vcr? {#what-vcr}

The short version is: `vcr` helps you stub HTTP requests so you don't have to repeat HTTP requests.

The main use case is for unit tests for R packages.

`vcr` currently only works with the `crul` package, but we plan to make it work with `httr`.

`vcr` works by hooking into `webmockr`. However, when `webmockr` finds a match, we then look for a recorded interaction on disk. If one is not found, we record the request and response. If one is found, we use that recorded interaction to construct a real response as the R client expects.

## Why crul? {#why-crul}

`crul` is just one of the HTTP clients in R. It's the one that I maintain though, so was easiest to get started with adding mocking integration.

We do plan to add integration for `httr` in the future to both `webmockr` and `vcr`.
